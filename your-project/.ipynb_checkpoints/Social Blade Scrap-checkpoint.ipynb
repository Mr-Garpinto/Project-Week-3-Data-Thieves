So seeing \"Space Force\" promoted disgusts me ! Why didn't donald have an American flag deploy ? This is about the best of the best brilliant minds, I am not religious, but at each launch,  I say a little prayer, these teams have another success, this is truly inspiring ! Every time I heard \"Space Force\" I wanted to throw up a little ! Have you all seen the Netflix movie \"Space Force\" Sad, but true, and pretty damn funny ! Leave BS on the ground !

      "You look at this flight and it seems oh so easy.  Up it goes and down it comes. Nine engines give a boost and one engine does the rest. A couple of titanium grid fins pop out and some small control Thrusters bring it down. The booster lands at sea on a small platform 350 or so miles away where we can now see it land via a camera. Then back home again for another flight. Simple? It is in reality a mind bending technical achievement with most of the parts hidden from sight. No one in the history of the world has ever done this before.  Yes, some have done a part of it but not like this. Of course some of what each of those did in the past have contributed to this accomplishment as well but it is SpaceX who put it all together. Can't forget  all of the workers who get the job done and Maria Pointer who brings the finer points to us everyday. Thanks.\n",

      "Nice!  As always.  Hey SpaceX I have an idea you might like. Before you retire the Falcon system you should use it to give everyone on the planet a taste of the dream and adventure.  Raffle off seats on either the Crew Dragon or Crew Dragon 2 for a free return flight around the Moon.  Use the Falcon Heavy Lifter to send a Crew capsule to the Moon and back with 3 civilians, one partial orbit, free return trajectory at a few tens of km above the Moon.  One chair would have to be used by an experienced pilot.  Have 3 tiers of raffle tickets. I bet you could easily sell a billion raffle tickets worldwide for $1 U.S. for one seat on the flight. That would be the lowest tier where a person's odds would be like one in a few hundred million.  For the next tier cut the odds by a thousand or so and sell those for $1,000 a ticket.  The next tier would be a million dollar ticket with a good one in a few dozen odds.  You would have to scale it to cost per seat, so the odds were those steps, $1, $1,000,00 and $1,000,000,000.  It would be a great promo for the company and SpaceX would get some practice sending random civilians into space.  If there were great interest and sales it may take a few flights to satisfy demands for tickets.  Run the raffle, see how many tickets you sell, figure how many flights that buys, either break even for the promo and practice, or with some profit. I bet SpaceX could launch them late 2021 or sooner, as soon as Crew 2 gets certified or Crew 1 can be upgraded a little for the 7 day flight (lots of room in the trunk it seems), add lunar mission navigation and test that before Crew 2.  I bet SpaceX could think of other practical development reasons for the flights.  As always, whatever you do, keep doing it!\n",

      "Considerando que, informes extensos y creíbles han revelado asesinatos en masa de prisioneros de conciencia en la República Popular de China, principalmente de practicantes de los ejercicios espirituales de Falun Gong, pero también de otros grupos religiosos y de minorías étnicas, para obtener órganos para trasplantes; y\n",

      "Considerando que, el sistema de trasplante de órganos en China no cumple con los Principios Rectores de la Organización Mundial de la Salud sobre el origen y la transparencia en las vías de obtención de órganos, y que el gobierno de la República Popular de China se ha resistido al escrutinio independiente del sistema; y\n",
      "\n",
      "Considerando que, la costumbre tradicional china requiere que los cuerpos se conserven intactos después de la muerte. Sin embargo, con la rara donación voluntaria de órganos, la industria de trasplantes de China aumentó significativamente desde 2000; y\n",
      "\n",
      "Considerando que, en el informe de la Freedom House de 2017 \"La batalla por el espíritu de China\", se afirma que \"la evidencia disponible sugiere que la sustracción forzada de órganos de los detenidos de Falun Gong para la venta en operaciones de trasplante ha ocurrido en gran escala y puede continuar\"; y\n",
      "\n",
      "Considerando que, un informe de investigación publicado en junio de 2016, realizado por el abogado de derechos humanos David Matas, por el ex secretario de Estado canadiense para Asia-Pacífico, David Kilgour, y por el periodista Ethan Gutmann, estimó que China está realizando entre 60.000 y 100.000 trasplantes por año, en comparación con 10.000 trasplantes declarados por el gobierno chino, que es \"un sistema de trasplante de órganos dirigido por el estado a escala industrial, controlado a través de políticas y financiamiento nacionales, e involucrando a los sistemas de salud civiles y militares\"; y\n",

      "such waste of money and resources... I don't know why they launch things using fossil fuels. are people really saying it's not possible to use magnets (similar tech that is being used in railguns) to launch something into orbit? What about a huge \"cannon\" built along side of a mountain, pointing upwards under about 50-60 degree angle, capable of shooting something into earth's orbit with minimal fuel usage, would that not be simpler? Sure it would be far more expensive to build, but then you can basically launch things onto orbit for free. I'm quite sure such orbital cannon would be possible, but governments are more interested in spending BILLIONS on military tech that can kill others .... this planet is pathetic, humans are pathetic and primitive and hostile ... if they would all put their money and resources together and just STOP fighting eachother, we'd already be colonizing Mars and travel beyond Sol. .. I guess it will take a good 500-1000 years before humans stop acting like apes and start cooperating with eachother instead of fighting eachother.\n",

      "Compared to the drive technology we have locked up in Deep State Aerospace Black projects, this is akin to lighting your home with Whale Oil. However, I must admit, it is still pretty darned cool to see the Buck Rogers maneuver landing that engine on a drone ship at sea. Yup, pretty darned cool.  If all of you at Space Command are not already hands-on with the advanced propulsion technology, you will be soon enough. I know that all you will do a fine job keeping all of us \"land lubbers\" (not by choice) down here safe as situations \"up there\" change faster than should allowed by the laws of physics (even the bogus ones we have been fed for over 120 years). As the newer 12\" and 14\" advanced telescope technology became available for us civilian schlubs combined with the advanced digital video enhancements we have been working on (to circumvent the stealth lighting techniques used up there), we can plainly see the 1000 or more very advanced vehicles orbiting the moon, and the 100 to 200 craft that lift off from this side of the moon on a near daily basis. And, when combined with the 50 or so 10 to 80km wide domed cities dotting the surface (just on this side, mostly in the Mares), an estimate of 190 million beings living on the moon is probably somewhat conservative. What led us to work on by passing (filtering) the stealth lighting techniques was the fact that we knew that the moon was not a colorless, bright black & white object (body). It is mostly brown or tan with several other colors mixed in. We can even see spots of green under many of the domes where plant life (forests?) appear to be growing quite nicely. And when we combined what our technology provided with the higher resolution images we acquired from the Clementine Project, no further confirmation was needed. When you find out who they are up there, and what they are really doing (relative to our existence), we would love to know.  It's just a guess, but I suspect you will find a mix of Giants and Grays living up there (with a few token humans mixed in). The way I figure it, someone has to keep an eye on the cattle (or prisoners, depending on how you look at us), and that would surely be an ideal base of operations for just such a mission, don't you think?  Good luck to all of you. You really have your work cut out for you, especially if all of you are on \"our\" side (and I suspect that you are), because it won't be long now and \"the fecal matter will collide with the air handler\"  because 2046 is a hell of a lot closer than it sounds, especially if the last 10 to 15 years are filled with mass pandemonium.\n",
