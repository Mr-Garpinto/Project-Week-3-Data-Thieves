Before you retire the Falcon system you should use it to give everyone on the planet a taste of the dream and adventure.  Raffle off seats on either the Crew Dragon or Crew Dragon 2 for a free return flight around the Moon.  Use the Falcon Heavy Lifter to send a Crew capsule to the Moon and back with 3 civilians, one partial orbit, free return trajectory at a few tens of km above the Moon.  One chair would have to be used by an experienced pilot.  Have 3 tiers of raffle tickets. I bet you could easily sell a billion raffle tickets worldwide for $1 U.S. for one seat on the flight. That would be the lowest tier where a person's odds would be like one in a few hundred million.  For the next tier cut the odds by a thousand or so and sell those for $1,000 a ticket.  The next tier would be a million dollar ticket with a good one in a few dozen odds.  You would have to scale it to cost per seat, so the odds were those steps, $1, $1,000,00 and $1,000,000,000.  It would be a great promo for the company and SpaceX would get some practice sending random civilians into space.  If there were great interest and sales it may take a few flights to satisfy demands for tickets.  Run the raffle, see how many tickets you sell, figure how many flights that buys, either break even for the promo and practice, or with some profit. I bet SpaceX could launch them late 2021 or sooner, as soon as Crew 2 gets certified or Crew 1 can be upgraded a little for the 7 day flight (lots of room in the trunk it seems), add lunar mission navigation and test that before Crew 2.

Tambi\u00e9n indic\u00f3 que el dram\u00e1tico aumento de los trasplantes de \u00f3rganos en China se correlacion\u00f3 con el inicio de la persecuci\u00f3n a Falun Dafa en julio de 1999.\r\n\r\nFalun Gong, tambi\u00e9n conocido como Falun Dafa, es una antigua disciplina de meditaci\u00f3n espiritual con tres valores fundamentales: Verdad, Benevolencia y Tolerancia. Atrajo a casi 100 millones de practicantes en China a los pocos a\u00f1os de su presentaci\u00f3n p\u00fablica en mayo de 1992 y, por lo tanto, se ha convertido en el mayor grupo de prisioneros de conciencia en China desde el inicio de la campa\u00f1a sin precedentes dise\u00f1ada para erradicar a la pr\u00e1ctica de China.\r\n\r\nLa SCR 6 tambi\u00e9n pide al gobierno chino que ponga fin a la persecuci\u00f3n de Falun Dafa y que libere a todos sus practicantes.\r\n\r\nLa representante Lynn Morris promovi\u00f3 la versi\u00f3n de esta resoluci\u00f3n en la C\u00e1mara y present\u00f3 la SCR 6 en el pleno de la C\u00e1mara. \"Estamos tratando no solo de educar a los ciudadanos de Missouri y de Estados Unidos, sino de educar al mundo sobre lo que est\u00e1 pasando con las personas que practican Falun Dafa en China\", dijo.\r\n\r\nDurante la audiencia para la SCR 6 realizada por el Comit\u00e9 de Seguridad Nacional de la C\u00e1mara de Representantes el 9 de abril de 2019, el testimonio de las v\u00edctimas de la persecuci\u00f3n conmovi\u00f3 al presidente Ron Hicks. \"Estoy  sin palabras\", dijo, despu\u00e9s de escuchar el testimonio de un investigador de biolog\u00eda de St. Louis que sobrevivi\u00f3 a torturas brutales y cuya esposa fue torturada hasta la muerte por practicar Falun Dafa en China en 2003.\r\n\r\nEl representante Hicks indic\u00f3 que piensa que la resoluci\u00f3n es significativa y que tendr\u00e1 un gran impacto.

Sin embargo, con la rara donaci\u00f3n voluntaria de \u00f3rganos, la industria de trasplantes de China aument\u00f3 significativamente desde 2000; y\r\n\r\nConsiderando que, en el informe de la Freedom House de 2017 \"La batalla por el esp\u00edritu de China\", se afirma que \"la evidencia disponible sugiere que la sustracci\u00f3n forzada de \u00f3rganos de los detenidos de Falun Gong para la venta en operaciones de trasplante ha ocurrido en gran escala y puede continuar\"; y\r\n\r\nConsiderando que, un informe de investigaci\u00f3n publicado en junio de 2016, realizado por el abogado de derechos humanos David Matas, por el ex secretario de Estado canadiense para Asia-Pac\u00edfico, David Kilgour, y por el periodista Ethan Gutmann, estim\u00f3 que China est\u00e1 realizando entre 60.000 y 100.000 trasplantes por a\u00f1o, en comparaci\u00f3n con 10.000 trasplantes declarados por el gobierno chino, que es \"un sistema de trasplante de \u00f3rganos dirigido por el estado a escala industrial, controlado a trav\u00e9s de pol\u00edticas y financiamiento nacionales, e involucrando a los sistemas de salud civiles y militares\"; y", "Best CGI in the business", "space x is working with trump i dont trust them", "while the whole world is freaking out, Elon is planning his escape.

If all of you at Space Command are not already hands-on with the advanced propulsion technology, you will be soon enough. I know that all you will do a fine job keeping all of us \"land lubbers\" (not by choice) down here safe as situations \"up there\" change faster than should allowed by the laws of physics (even the bogus ones we have been fed for over 120 years). As the newer 12\" and 14\" advanced telescope technology became available for us civilian schlubs combined with the advanced digital video enhancements we have been working on (to circumvent the stealth lighting techniques used up there), we can plainly see the 1000 or more very advanced vehicles orbiting the moon, and the 100 to 200 craft that lift off from this side of the moon on a near daily basis. And, when combined with the 50 or so 10 to 80km wide domed cities dotting the surface (just on this side, mostly in the Mares), an estimate of 190 million beings living on the moon is probably somewhat conservative. What led us to work on by passing (filtering) the stealth lighting techniques was the fact that we knew that the moon was not a colorless, bright black & white object (body). It is mostly brown or tan with several other colors mixed in. We can even see spots of green under many of the domes where plant life (forests?) appear to be growing quite nicely. And when we combined what our technology provided with the higher resolution images we acquired from the Clementine Project, no further confirmation was needed. When you find out who they are up there, and what they are really doing (relative to our existence), we would love to know.  It's just a guess, but I suspect you will find a mix of Giants and Grays living up there (with a few token humans mixed in). The way I figure it, someone has to keep an eye on the cattle (or prisoners, depending on how you look at us), and that would surely be an ideal base of operations for just such a mission, don't you think?  Good luck to all of you.
