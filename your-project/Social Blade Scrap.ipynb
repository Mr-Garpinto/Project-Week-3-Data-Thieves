The engine accessories mostly come from the GM parts bin, so again mostly cheap and durable - just don't buy them from the RR dealer. The body is steel so bodywork isn't ruinously expensive like the aluminium bodied Phantom.\\n\\nOn the downside the sheer weight of this beast will take a toll on suspension components. Proprietary parts, especially interior trim bits, will be horrifically expensive. As for performance and handling.... It has a huge but anemic V8 and weighs as much as heavy duty pickup truck. I imagine the driving experience would be like late 70's american land yacht. This is a car to be driven in, with a chauffeur paid to drive it.\\n\\nA Bently Arnage is the same car with a turbocharged engine and more driver focused suspension tuning. Turbocharged big block V8, lackadaisical revs, decent HP/lb, and stump pulling low RPM torque to move it's considerable bulk with some alacrity. Canyon carver? Hell no. Super car? Not really.
